# Contributing to Nest-kit


# Instructions

## 1. Fork the Repository to your own Github Account

## 2. Reference an Issue

Code and changelogs work better when work references an actual tracking item that helps to understand why it happened. For this reason changes should only be made if they're referencing a documented issue.

Feel free to reference an existing open issue or create a new one with a brief title and/or description


## 3. Check out a new branch that references the issue

Pick a good branch name. Try something that summarizes what you're doing in a descriptive way. Optionally include the issue number:

* feature/{number}-my-new-thing
* docs/improve-readme
* fix/{number}some-bug


## 4. Push your changes

Be sure to include a reference to the issue number on the branch comments, e.g:

closes #{number}

re #{number}

**Happy coding**!
